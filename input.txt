i want to search a set of contracts that are available in vector database. When the user asks a question, i would like to first search the vector db, retrieve the chunks that match the question and then use this as a context to answer the main question by LLM. I want you take the question and tell me which keywords should i use for searching the vector database. The question asked is: how many contracts are there for service now for the year 2023.
