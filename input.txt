Foreign Currency
We are potentially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments in subsidiaries, transactions (both third-party and intercompany) and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Management assesses foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contract and currency swaps with highly-rated financial institutions to reduce fluctuations in the long or short currency positions. Forward contracts are generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the terms of the underlying debt issues.

At November 30, 2020, we had foreign currency exchange contracts to purchase or sell $383.8 million of foreign currencies as compared to $489.2 million at November 30, 2019. All of these contracts were designated as hedges of anticipated purchases denominated in a foreign currency or hedges of foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. Hedge ineffectiveness was not material. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at November 30, 2020 have durations of less than 18 months.
Contracts which are designated as hedges of anticipated purchases denominated in a foreign currency (generally purchases of raw materials in U.S. dollars by operating units outside the U.S.) are considered cash flow hedges. The gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in cost of goods sold, at which time the net amount deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income is also recognized in cost of goods sold. Gains and losses from contracts that are designated as hedges of assets, liabilities or firm commitments are recognized through income, offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item.
We also enter into fair value foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations in certain intercompany loans between subsidiaries as well as currency exposure to third-party non-functional currency assets or liabilities. The notional value of these contracts was $212.3 million and $357.5 million at November 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Any gains or losses recorded based on both the change in fair value of these contracts and the change in the currency component of the underlying loans are recognized in our consolidated income statement as other income, net.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we also utilized cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are designated as net investment hedges. As of November 30, 2020, we had cross currency interest rate swap contracts of (i) $250 million notional value to receive $250 million at three-month U.S. LIBOR plus 0.685% and pay £194.1 million at three-month GBP LIBOR plus 0.740% and (ii) £194.1 million notional value to receive £194.1 million at three-month GBP LIBOR plus 0.740% and pay €221.8 million at three-month Euro EURIBOR plus 0.808%. These cross-currency interest rate swap contracts expire in August 2027.
Interest Rates
We finance a portion of our operations with both fixed and variable rate debt instruments, primarily commercial paper, notes and bank loans. We utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of variable and fixed rate debt.
As of November 30, 2020 and 2019, we have outstanding interest rate swap contracts for a notional amount of $350.0 million. Those interest rate swap contracts include a $100 million notional value of interest rate swap contracts where we receive interest at 3.25% and pay a variable rate of interest based on three-month LIBOR plus 1.22%. These swaps, which expire in November 2025, are designated as fair value hedges of the changes in fair value of $100 million of the $250 million 3.25% medium-term notes due 2025. We also have $250 million notional interest rate swap contracts where we receive interest at 3.40% and pay a variable rate of interest based on three-month LIBOR plus 0.685%, which expire in August 2027, and are designated as fair value hedges of the changes in fair value of $250 million of the $750 million 3.40% term notes due 2027.
Any unrealized gain or loss on these swaps was offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in the value of the hedged debt. Hedge ineffectiveness was not material.
All derivatives are recognized at fair value in our balance sheet and recorded in either other current assets, or other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities or other long-term liabilities depending upon their nature and maturity

Net Investment Hedges
As of March 27, 2021, the Company had multiple fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of $3 billion to hedge its net investment in Euro-denominated subsidiaries and $194 million to hedge its net investment in Japanese Yen-denominated subsidiaries against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and these currencies. Under the term of these contracts, the Company will exchange the semi-annual fixed rate payments on U.S. denominated debt for fixed rate payments of 0% to 4.508% in Euros and 0% to 3.588% in Japanese Yen. Certain of these contracts include mandatory early termination dates between November 2022 and February 2026, while the remaining contracts have maturity dates between July 2022 and August 2027. These contracts have been designated as net investment hedges
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, the Company terminated all of its net investment hedges related to its Euro-denominated subsidiaries. The early termination of these hedges resulted in the Company receiving $296 million in cash during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of $211 million being recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020.
When a cross-currency swap is used as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge assessed under the spot method, the cross-currency basis spread is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and is recognized as a reduction in interest expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Accordingly, the Company recorded a reduction in interest expense of $16 million, $71 million and $17 million, respectively, during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019.
Interest Rate Swap
As of March 27, 2021, the Company had an interest rate swap with an initial notional amount of $500 million that will decrease to $350 million in April 2022. The swap was designated as a cash flow hedge designed to mitigate the impact of adverse interest rate fluctuations for a portion of the Company’s variable-rate debt equal to the notional amount of the swap. The interest rate swap converts the one-month Adjusted LIBOR interest rate on these borrowings to a fixed interest rate of 0.237% through December 2022.
When an interest rate swap agreement qualifies for hedge accounting as a cash flow hedge, the changes in the fair value are recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. During Fiscal 2021, the Company recorded an immaterial amount of interest expense related to this agreement.
